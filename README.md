# MultipleHypothesisTracking
This repository contains matlab code for a complete instance of multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm. The code is revised from https://github.com/MetricCV/mht

Multiple hypothesis tracking is a common-used multi-target tracking algorithm which is used for computer vision and radar signal processing. It has superior performance to traditional multi-target tracking algorithms such as JPDA(joint probablity data association) and GNN(Gated Nearest neighborhood).
