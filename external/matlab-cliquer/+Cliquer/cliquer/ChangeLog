Version 1.21:
	Fixed minor bug in Makefile

Version 1.2:
	Fixed a fatal bug in the reordering function
	reorder_graph. Using this function on a weighted
	graph has corrupted the graph in earlier versions.

	New default for the numbering of vertices in output from cl:
	1 to n instead of 0 to n-1. New parameter -0 --from-0
        instead of -1 --1-to-n.
	
Version 1.1:
	Fixed a few bugs in resizing sets and graphs.
	
Version 1.0:
	First public "official" release.
